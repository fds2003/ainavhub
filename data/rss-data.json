      "description": "arXiv:2510.25933v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We introduce Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model that matches GPT-4o on the FACTS Grounding public subset within a $\\pm 5$ pp equivalence margin.\n  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI 69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's $d = 0.023$).
