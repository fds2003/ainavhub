      "description": "arXiv:2511.13987v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper presents an integrative review and experimental validation of artificial intelligence (AI) agents applied to music analysis and education. We synthesize the historical evolution from rule-based models to contemporary approaches involving deep learning, multi-agent architectures, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks. The pedagogical implications are evaluated through a dual-case methodology: (1) the use of generative AI pl",
