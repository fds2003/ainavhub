      "description": "arXiv:2511.07436v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The integration of AI tools into medical applications has aimed to improve the efficiency of diagnosis. The emergence of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, has expanded this integration even further. Because of LLM versatility and ease of use through APIs, these larger models are often utilised even though smaller, custom models can be used instead. In this paper, LLMs and small discriminative models are integrated into a Me",

Despite research showing that domain-dependent, procedural knowledge can dramatically increase planning efficiency, little work evaluates its potential for improving LLM performance on agentic tasks that may require implicit planning. We formalize, implement, and evaluate an agentic LLM workflow that leve",
