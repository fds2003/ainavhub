      "description": "arXiv:2510.21999v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Math word problem (MWP) serves as a fundamental research topic in artificial intelligence (AI) dating back to 1960s. This research aims to advance the reasoning abilities of AI by mirroring the human-like cognitive intelligence. The mainstream technological paradigm has evolved from the early rule-based methods, to deep learning models, and is rapidly advancing towards large language models. However, the field still lacks a systematic taxonomy for",
