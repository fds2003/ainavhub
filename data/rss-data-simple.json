      "description": "arXiv:2602.15212v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In this paper, we introduce a secure wireless agentic AI network comprising one supervisor AI agent and multiple other AI agents to provision quality of service (QoS) for users' reasoning tasks while ensuring confidentiality of private knowledge and reasoning outcomes. Specifically, the supervisor AI agent can dynamically assign other AI agents to participate in cooperative reasoning, while the unselected AI agents act as friendly jammers to degra",

To instantiate this, we repurpose five oral and spotlight papers from ICML, ICLR, and ACL. From each paper's repository, we preserve the datasets, evaluation harness, and baseline implementations but withhold the paper's proposed method. This results in five containerized task environments comprising 39 sub-tasks in total. Within each e",

Traditionally, this risk is managed through the buyer's irrevocable payment undertaking (IPU), which commits to full payment without deductions.
